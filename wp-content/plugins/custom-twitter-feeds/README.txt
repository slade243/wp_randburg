= Setting up the Free Custom Twitter Feeds WordPress Plugin =

The Custom Twitter Feeds plugin is brand new and so we're currently working on improving our documentation for it. If you have an issue or question please submit a support ticket and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

1) Once you've installed the plugin click on the Twitter Feed item in your WordPress menu

2) Click on the large blue Twitter login button to get your Twitter Access Token and Twitter Secret. Note; if you have your own Twitter Developer App set up then you can enter your Twitter information manually by enabling the checkbox below the Twitter login button.

3) Authorize the plugin to read your Tweets.
Note; the plugin does not obtain permission to edit or write to your Twitter account, only to read your Twitter content.

4) Twitter sends back your Twitter Access Token and Twitter Secret which are then automatically saved by the Custom Twitter Feeds plugin. This information is required in order to connect to the Twitter API.

5) Enter a Twitter screenname to display Tweets from. Alternatively, choose to display Tweets from your Twitter home timeline or a Twitter hashtag.

6) Navigate to the Customize and Style pages to customize your Twitter feed.

7) Once you've customized your Twitter feed, click on the "Display Your Feed" tab for directions on how to display your Twitter feed (or multiple feeds).

8) Copy the [custom-twitter-feeds] shortcode and paste it into any page, post or widget where you want the Twitter feed to appear.

9) You can paste the [custom-twitter-feeds] shortcode directly into your page editor.

10) You can use the default WordPress 'Text' widget to display your Twitter Feed in a sidebar or other widget area.
 
11) View your website to see your Twitter feed(s) in all their glory!

If you receive an error message when trying to display your Twitter Feed then you can use the error reference below to diagnose the issue and find the relevant solution.

**Error:**

**Error:**
Sorry, that page does not exist

**Causes:**
- There may be a typo in the Twitter screen name or hashtag you are attempting to use

**Solutions**

**#1 - Your Twitter access tokens might not be valid**

The easiest way to verify this is by going back to the Settings page for the Custom Twitter Feeds plugin and clicking the big blue button on the "Configure" tab to get new Twitter access tokens. If you haven't set up your own Twitter App, the only way to use the Custom Twitter Feeds plugin is to click the big blue button to get a Twitter access token and Twitter access token secret that is compatible with the default Twitter client used by Smash Balloon.

**#2 - You have checked the box to use your own Twitter app information but one or more of the fields are incorrect**

All four fields, consumer token, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret, need to come from the Twitter app that you set up on Twitter.com. Try returning to your personal Twitter app management page https://apps.twitter.com/ and confirming that all four fields, consumer token, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret, and entered correctly in the corresponding fields on the plugin's "Configure" tab.

**#3 - You may need to raise the number of tweets to retrieve**

Navigate to the type of Twitter feed you are trying to display on twitter.com. For example, if you are displaying a feed from the screenname "smashballoon", go to https://twitter.com/smashballoon. Make sure there are tweets visible. Then click on the link "Tweets & replies". If there are a more recent replies than original tweets, there may be too many tweets being filtered out to display any. Replies are removed by default. You can raise the number of tweets to retrieve initially by going to the Custom Twitter Feed Settings page, "Customize" tab, and navigating to the "Advanced" area. Then raise the "Tweet Multiplier" and test to see if your Twitter feed now displays tweets.
